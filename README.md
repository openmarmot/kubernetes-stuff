# kubernetes-stuff
holding repo for misc kubernetes deployments and other stuff

somewhere to put all the random kubernetes + docker stuff I occasionally need instead of creating a ton of independent repos

[k3s] generally this is a kubernetes app yaml that is meant to work with the k3s servers i setup with my k3s templates from my ansible-stuff repo
